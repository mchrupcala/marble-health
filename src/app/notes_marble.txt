(scheduling a group therapy)

// create event -- select 1+ patients from a list
// no max here.
// lots of edge cases, don't worrya about those for now. happy path

    // everybody can access my calendar --

// persist -- when an event's saved, it should persist with those users

//name of a patient. don't worry about passwords/auth. nothing else

//ignore my existing events -- just for future events

/////

// pseduocode

// Users -- new model, create a user
// I can create dummy users in my DB. don't worry about the routes.

// getAllUsers()

// include e.user in the existing POST (create new event)

// ignore error handling
